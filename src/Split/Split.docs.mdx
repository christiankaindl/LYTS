import Split from './Split'
import Row from '../Row/Row'

# Split
Separates items along a single axis.

<Example2 />

export const Example2 = () => {
  return (
    <Split>
      <button>Back</button>
      <b>Centered Title</b>
      <Row>
        <button>Share</button>
        <button>Menu</button>
        <button>Manage</button>
      </Row>
    </Split>
  )
}

You can also just have 2 children:

<Split>
  <button>Back</button>

  <Row>
    <button>Share</button>
    <button>Menu</button>
    <button>Manage</button>
  </Row>
</Split>

You can use \<Split> in either vertical or horizontal direction.

## \<Split> vs. \<Row>

You can achieve a similar effect with Row and setting justify-content to "space-between". There's two reasons why not to do this:

1. Scanability. Different component names makes it easier to make out what the end-result of layout might look like.
2. Navbar handling
