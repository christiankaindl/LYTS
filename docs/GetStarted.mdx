# Get started

LYTS's goal is to make building layouts easier, faster and more maintainable. The components consist of low-level primitives which give a simple API you can build on top of.

Fundamentally, the code should express the designers intent as much as possible while staying flexible and composable. All components work out-of-the-box with zero configuration and sensible defaults.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @christiankaindl/lyts
```

## Usage

Import the components you need and compose them until you achieve your desired layout:

```jsx
const CenterCard: FunctionComponent = function () {
  return (
    <Clamp>
      <Stack gap={0.75} className='card'>
        <img />
        <h3></h3>
        <Row wrap gap={0.5}>
          items here
        </Row>
        <p></p>
        <Box xAlign='end'>Aligned at the end</Box>
      </Stack>
    </Clamp>
  )
}
```

Check out the Examples page for a comprehensive collection of layouts and how to build them with LYTS--Copy/Pasta ready of course :)
