- Add new `clamp` prop to Stack, Row and Columns out-of-the-box. If yes, then that would automatically wrap them in Clamp
- Columns "auto" keyword?
- Columns "/"-syntax confusing?
- Columns "style"-forwarding example would be good
- Columns xAlign doesn't do anything? (only has effect on mobile)
- Merge Columns and Row into one?
