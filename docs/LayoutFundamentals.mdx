# Layout fundamentals

## Alignment

## Composition

## User acceptance
Never should you put up a design which is not directly based on, or was tested by, your users. If you are one of the lucky who pursou their own dream in the form of a company, you can be your first user, but have also glaring blind spots.

The initial impression of a user who has never seen you site or product can be one of the most valuable things you can get. How easy is it to complete a lengthy checkout, while you are under time pressure? How forgiving is the form while you had to interrupt your task with something more important? How quick do you find the information you want to gauge, when you want to compare two products? Get hold of that experience, and routinely check it, to design things your users accept, and dare I say it, **love**.

## Rule of thumb
Everything in design is a rule of thumb. You are (most likely) designing for fellow humans, which means psychology is very much at play. How things are perceived by humans can be very much different to what is really going on, and thus psychology plays an important role.

Nevertheless design can be, and most often is, a rigorous process. One where you weight pros and cons of a particular feature or function, and decide based on the merits of the facts. Should the navigation be more prominent? Or have more or less items in it? What should be displayed above the fold, and what below? There is no shortage of research that helps anwer these questions, such as very brilliantly summarised in Jon Yablonski's [Laws of UX](https://lawsofux.com/).

But the merit of the facts won't always bring you closer to an answer. The navigation *should* be made more prominent if, and only if, it brings you closer to what matters to you (and subsequently your users.) Make the number of items smaller while your users are overwhelmed, and make it bigger if they can't find important information. There really are only rules of thumb--albeit quite good ones.

## Get creative & enjoy your work
A text written about layout and design without mention of the, probably, most commonly associated one would not be complete: creativity and joy. In the end, the designer wants to be proud of her work. And the user wants to be wowed by the ever-increasing of great design and visual "umph"--something which is also supported [by the merits](https://lawsofux.com/aesthetic-usability-effect/).
