# Clamp
Clamps its children to a max-width and centers them.

<Clamp clamp='800px'>
  <Stack>
    <h3>Hi, I'm clamped...</h3>
    <p>... to 800px</p>
  </Stack>
</Clamp>

## Recipes

### Landing page section

Here we use clamp for the overall centering, as well as to give the image on the right a max-width

### Overlay

Here we use both the horizontal and vertical clamping.
