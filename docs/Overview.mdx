# LYTS Overview

Example of code and the final layout and how they look similar.

## Global props

In addition of the domain of each layout component, all components support a few handy props:

### Bleed prop

Sometimes what is technically aligned is not visually aligned to our eyes. For example, consider this button:

Technically it is aligned perfectly with the rest of the card, but visually it does not work out the same way. To fix this LYTS has the `bleed` prop (and *Top/Right/Bottom/Left), which makes it easy to nudge the button to the left and "bleed" into the bounding box:

### Normalized xAlign/yAlign

When working with flexbox in can be confusing on which axis alignItems and justifyContent operates. When `flexDirection` is "row" ... when ... is .... LYTS normalizes this into xAlign and YAlign props which can be used on all of the components. Of course, manually supplying alignItems/justifyContent still works as is.

### asChild

Inspired by Radix UI's `asChild`, uses their implementation under the hood.
