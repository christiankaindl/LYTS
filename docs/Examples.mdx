# Examples

All examples from all components here...

### Align a single element (Box)

### Landing page section (Clamp)
Here we use clamp for the overall centering, as well as to give the image on the right a max-width

### Overlay (Clamp)
Here we use both the horizontal and vertical clamping.

### Landing page section (Columns, Stack)

export const Example2 = () => {
  return (
    <Columns ratio='1/2'>
      <Stack>
        <h3>Heading</h3>
        <p>Lorem ipsum</p>
      </Stack>
      <Stack>
        <h3>Heading</h3>
        <p>Lorem ipsum</p>
      </Stack>
    </Columns>
  )
}

<Example2 />

### Card (Columns, Stack, Split)

### Sidebar/Details view (Columns)

### Footer (Columns)

### Control center (Grid)
Using grid to create a compact controls interface

### Blog posts (Grid)

### Boxed lists (Row)
Boxed lists are becoming more and more common in UI design.

### Horizontal Navbar (Row, Split)
Common split pattern, wrapped into a two-line layout on mobile.

### Breadcrumbs (Row)
We can do both wrapped breadcrumbs, or scrolled breadcrumbs. For the scrolled breadcrumbs we are using the `bleed` prop to make sure the scrolling area stretches fully to the edges.

### Landing page section (Row)
Here we achieve a similar result as with Columns initially, but the wrapping behaviour is very different.

### Stepper/Checkout (Row)

### Vertical navbar (Stack, Split)

### Article (Stack)
