import Split from './Split'

# Split
Separate items along a single axis.

export const Example2 = () => {
  return (
    <Split>
      <button>Back</button>
      <b>Title</b>
      <button>Button right</button>
    </Split>
  )
}

<Example2 />

You can use \<Split> in either vertical or horizontal direction.

## \<Split> vs. \<Row>

You can achieve a similar effect with Row and setting justify-content to "space-between". There's two reasons why not to do this:

1. Scanability. Different component names makes it easier to make out what the end-result of layout might look like.
2. Navbar handling
