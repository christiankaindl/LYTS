# LYTS
![Abstract illustrations depicting the available layout components](./src/component-icons.png)
Layout primitives for React.

- Easy layouting - Powerful primitives for every layout
- Composable - Combine to create complex layouts
- Familiar - Apply standard CSS flexbox and grid knowledge

# Installation

```sh
npm install @christiankaindl/lyts
```

# Usage

Import one of the available components--Stack, Row, Clamp, Columns, Grid--and nest children inside it. Each layout component manages the flow of its direct children, and you can nest them to create complex layouts.

Full docs with API and examples are coming soon.
