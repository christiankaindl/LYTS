// TODO: Make more generic, by mirroring the technique for horizontal clamping
//       So, set gridTemplateRows when vertical clamping is used. This would unify how alignment works across horizontal/vertical clamping
//       and also fix yAlign, which currenlty does nothing on Clamp.

//       But that would (I think) also mean that Clamp can't support the `gap` prop anymore, as it has to be 0 (or otherwise it grows too large)
//       A workaround for this could be to dynamically replace "100%" with a calc: "1fr min(${fallbackVar(maxWidth, '100%')}, calc(100% - ${gap}*2)) 1fr"
